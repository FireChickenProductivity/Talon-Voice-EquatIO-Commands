# Dictating Variables
Letters are dictated using the community repository phonetic alphabet.

Greek letters can be dictated using their names except for theta, which is dictated by saying angle to improve accuracy (theta kept getting mixed up with beta and eta).

Capital english and greek letters can be dictated with Tall (letter) or Big (letter).

Because capital delta is more common in math than lower case delta, dictating delta produces upper case delta. Lower case delta is dictated as small delta.

Positive integers and letters dictated immediately after any letter other then capital delta are automatically subscripted.

Dictating flat or straight before dictating letters prevents automatic subscripting after them.

# Exponentiation
Dictating squared raises the previous character to the second power.

Dictating cubed raises the previous character to the third power.

Dictating inverse raises the previous character to the minus first power.

Dictating transpose gives the previous character the superscript T.

Dictating to the followed by an ordinal number from second, third ... through ninetyninth raises the previous character to the corresponding exponent (second gives 2, third gives 3, tenth gives 10, etc). 

Dictating the above exponentiation commands immediately after something that will be automatically subscripted will cause the exponentiation to go into the subscript.

Dictating power starts a superscript.

# Manual Subscripting
Dictating subscript, script, or sub manually starts a subscript.

# Movement Commands
who: moves the cursor to the right.

back: moves the cursor to the left.

cape: presses escape, which usually exits the current text container. Note that a normal Talon setup already has the command escape that already presses escape.

back cape or shift cape: presses shift escape, which usually exits the current text container by moving back.

out: goes to the end of the current line and then to the right. Useful for things like exiting parentheses, subscripts, and superscripts.

move: goes to the end of the current line.

<h2>Calculus Commands</h2>
<h3>Limits</h3>
limit: types lim and then subscripts.

goes to: produces a right arrow.

<h3>Integration</h3>
integrate: produces an integral symbol and leaves the cursor at the integral's lower bound.

integral: produces an integral symbol and moves the cursor to the right of it.

# Trigonometry Commands

# Matrix Commands
<h2>Making Matrices</h2>
matrix (small positive integer) [by] (small positive integer): creates a matrix surrounded by square brackets with the number of rows specified by the first integer and the number of columns specified by the second integer.

column (a small positive integer): creates a column surrounded by square brackets with the number of rows given by the integer.

matrix column (small positive integer) [by] (small positive integer): creates a matrix built out of columns surrounded by square brackets with the number of rows given by the first integer and the number of columns given by the second integer. This is useful if you want to input entries a column at a time instead of doing it a row at a time. Note that the matrix navigation commands will treat each column as its own matrix.

<h2>Navigating Matrices</h2>
The following movement commands assume that the cursor is within a matrix entry and not within another text container.

[go or move or matrix] entry (a small positive integer) (a small positive integer): goes to the entry at the row specified by the first positive integer and the column given by the second positive integer.

[go or move or matrix] first entry: goes to the first entry of the matrix.

[go or move or matrix] last entry: goes to the last entry of the matrix.

[go or move or matrix] next entry: goes to the next entry of the matrix.

[go or move or matrix] (previous or back): goes to the previous entry of the matrix.

<h2>Miscellaneous</h2>
new column: creates a new column if within matrix.

leave matrix left: leaves the matrix and goes to the left.

leave matrix right: leaves the matrix and goes to the right. Unfortunately, this command only moves to the right of the innermost container of the matrix, so using this command with a matrix with multiple containers (such as multiple parentheses, lines, or square brackets) does not completely get you out of the matrix.

send (a list of symbols that can be small integers, minus signs, or decimal points): inputs the symbols into the matrix and attempts to go to the next entry after each number (the cursor must not be within a text container within the matrix for it to go to the next entry properly).
