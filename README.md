# Dictating Variables
Letters are dictated using the community repository phonetic alphabet.

Greek letters can be dictated using their names except for theta, which is dictated by saying angle to improve accuracy (theta kept getting mixed up with beta and eta).

Capital english and greek letters can be dictated with Tall (letter) or Big (letter).

Because capital delta is more common in math than lower case delta, dictating delta produces upper case delta. Lower case delta is dictated as small delta.

Positive integers and letters dictated immediately after any letter other then capital delta are automatically subscripted.

Dictating flat or straight before dictating letters prevents automatic subscripting after them.

# Exponentiation
Dictating squared raises the previous character to the second power.

Dictating cubed raises the previous character to the third power.

Dictating inverse raises the previous character to the minus first power.

Dictating transpose gives the previous character the superscript T.

Dictating to the followed by an ordinal number from second, third ... through ninetyninth raises the previous character to the corresponding exponent (second gives 2, third gives 3, tenth gives 10, etc). 

Dictating the above exponentiation commands immediately after something that will be automatically subscripted will cause the exponentiation to go into the subscript.

Dictating power starts a superscript.

# Manual Subscripting
Dictating subscript, script, or sub manually starts a subscript.

# Symbol Commands
stuff in square brackets is optional
