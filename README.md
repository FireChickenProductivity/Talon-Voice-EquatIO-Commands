# Talon-Voice-EquatIO-Commands
Talon voice commands for dictating math into EquatIO.

# Dictating variables
Letters are dictated using the community repository phonetic alphabet.

Greek letters can be dictated using their names except for theta, which is dictated by saying angle to improve accuracy (theta kept getting mixed up with beta and eta).

Capital english and greek letters can be dictated with Tall (letter) or Big (letter).

Because capital delta is more common in math than lower case delta, dictating delta produces upper case delta. Lower case delta is dictated as small delta.

Positive integers and letters dictated immediately after any letter other then capital delta are automatically subscripted.

Dictating flat or straight before dictating letters prevents automatic subscripting after them.
